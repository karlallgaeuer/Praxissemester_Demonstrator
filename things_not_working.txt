List of things not working:
-Pictures don't open on click (The link includes an unsafe tag probably added by angular)
-Constraints missing for the use cases
-Error when opening the project with enabled browser security ("Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8090/getTypes' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.")
-Duplicate type/format entries in the dropdown boxes (They are present more than once in the ontology)
-Checkboxes don't change their state
